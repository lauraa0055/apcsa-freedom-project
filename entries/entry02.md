The past few days I have been researching more about the topic I picked: Firebase. I need an app in order to actually tinker with the code, but nonetheless I did what I could.

I looked at videos explaining how to connected firebase to the app that is being worked on. I also continued to explore the firebase console and website.

In the end I mainly took notes in a seperate google document explaining my findings in firebase. I also made a new partner in figuring out firebase. She is a classmate who is working on another project, but because her main focus is also on firebase we decided to work together in understanding firebase.

On the other side of spectrum I also decided to start designing my app. I did not go into detail like the colors and the fonts. Although having a general idea as to what the app will look like is better than having no plan at all.

I made a design for how the calendar will look like monthly, weekly, and when the user only wants to see the upcoming events/due dates.
Because I personally want to make widgets for the app, I also design the widgets and how the user will be able to interact with them.

On the other hand I also made rough sketches and ideas for the user interface, or how the user will interact with the app.

When designing the app I questioned my friend if having certain features will make them want to use the app.
The answer I given to me was yes. Their explination being that the way I plan to make the app seems more simple and easy.

That helped me learn something that should have been obvious. Gesture based controls that are simple will get the user to feel more comfortable when using the app because of how fast and easy it is to navigate it.

Overall however I do feel like I am making progress since I have a general idea as to how my app is going to look like, and how the user will be able to user the app.
