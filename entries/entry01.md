**First Day**

In APCSA we are learning java. Once Friday hits however, it is time to start on the Freedom Project. Our teacher wants us to learn a different language or use Java itself to make our own project.

I personally do not know what it is that I want to work on, but I do know that I want to make an  iPhone app.
Knowing that I know that I will be learning swift one way or another.

At first I was thinking of making a productivity app that keep all my homework in one place and gives me reminders of tests and quizzes.
Although there is someone else in my class who is already doing that and I would rather not repeat ideas.

Instead I am thinking about making an app that helps you focus by locking certain apps
at a specific time. By locking I mean not being able to access an app.

Regarding information I was actually researching something completely different.
I was and still am very interested about contactless student ID's. It is basically being
able to access/enter a building just by using your phone. Or in different words, it is like apple pay
but for your student ID.

I did have another initial idea for my project, but it seems too complicated and it would require
an NFC tag which requires another long period of research.
While I do wish to do this in the future it is also best to be reasonable about what I am capable of doing
with the tools I am given. If I see an opportunity to possibly start my idea then I will take it.
Although for now I wish to do something that helps people concentrate.

Knowing what it is that I want to do (for now) I did do some research and I found that in the App store for iPhones
there aren't any good apps that help the user concentrate. At least not good enough to keep me from reaching my phone.

Most of the apps available that are designed to keep the user focused at a task have almost the same concept.
Make some sort of rewarding system that will encourage the user to stay focused and not touch their phones.
If the user does end up leaving the app or using a social media app, the concentration app will give a consequence
like killing off a virtual tree.
Many of these apps are nice and have a friendly interface, but even with their reward systems some people just end up giving up and not trying.

On top of that, many of these apps require some sort of payment in order to give the user the full experience.
I personally have trouble concentrating when doing homework. I have tried some of these apps but their reward systems do not work sometimes.
I always end up back in instagram and looking at bird memes.
In order to keep me concentrated in one task, that app has to be off limits until I finish my work or a certain amount of time has been reached.

Keeping all of this in mind I have thought about it deeply and I am leaning towards making an app that locks other apps in order to keep the user
focused at the task at hand. It may seem annoying to the user at first.
They may think "why should I lock instagram or snapchat? That'll just be a waste of time".
Although just like you have to keep drawing in order to become a better artist, you need to continue to force yourself to stay focused until you are no longer
forcing yourself. My goal for this app is for people to become used to not going into social media apps, or games, or a distracting website while they are trying to do their work
until they no longer need the app anymore.
